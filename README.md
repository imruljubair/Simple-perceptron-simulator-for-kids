# Simple-perceptron-simulator-for-kids

This is one of my hobby projects. I have built a very simple perceptron that can classify linearly seperable data. It is built from the scratch, even numpy has not been used. It helped me to understand how perceptron really works. I used matplotlib animation to render the steps of learning.

In the code, a linearly seperated dataset is created based on function f(x,y), i.e. f(x,y)7x-3y+5=0, which seperates the data into two classes. Then the perceptron starts with random values of weights and bias, and adjusts the values iteratively. Finally it comes up wih a decision and draws a line to seperate two classes.
